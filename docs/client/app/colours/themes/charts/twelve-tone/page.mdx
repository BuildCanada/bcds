# Twelve-Tone Charts

This is a fairly niche application that has had excessive exploration.

These are sequential themes for use with complex stacked-bar charts. 

The goal is to present *a lot* of related categories in a distinguishable way. 

Charts *usually* shouldn't present more than 5 categories as a colour.

Additionally, due to the phenomenon leading to observations like [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), most ideas that are presentable as stacked bars have such disparity between the leading category and 5th+ category that the chart areas are difficult to render, let alone distinguish.

And yet, here are 12-tone sequential charts.
