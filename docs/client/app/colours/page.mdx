# Colours

The Build Canada Design System makes use of tailwind-style colour systems and several themes for compatability with various front end systems for purposes like:
- AI Front End Creation
- Consistent Charts
- Graphic Design

There are two key categories for colour:
1. **Swatches:** for building custom components, graphics, or themes
2. **Themes:** for building entire applications, charts, and graphs.

## Usage

#### CSS Usage

```css
@import "@buildcanada/colours/main.css";

.custom-style {
    background-color: var(--color-linen-100);
    color: var(--color-charcoal-900);
};
```

#### Tailwind Usage

First, import the main.css file to your globals.css or similar.

Then, you have convenient access to tailwind and shadcn styles as needed:
```tsx
export default function Example() {
  return <div className="bg-background"> {/* ShadCN style aliases */}
    <p className="text-charcoal-900">Example</p> {/* Tailwind style aliases */}
  </div>
}
```

#### Typescript Usage

```tsx
import { linen, charcoal, auburn } from "@buildcanada/colours";

const red = auburn[800];
const background = linen[100];
const foreground = charcoal[900];

export default function ExampleChart() {
  return <div style={{backgroundColor: background}}></div>
}
```


## Swatches

There are 3 categories of colours in the tailwind-style colour system:
- Core
- Muted
- Vibrant

All swatches are accessible as both CSS and Typescript objects. 


### Core

The two properly Tailwind-style colour systems are Linen and Auburn.

There is also a third key core colour, Charcoal, that uses an extended palette.

<CoreSwatches />


### Muted

The Muted set is designed to work closely with the Core colour system, modelling similar saturation levels across gradients to create a cohesive look.

<MutedSwatches />

### Vibrant

The vibrant set is designed to contrast in the saturation dimension from the Core and Muted sets - use as needed for charts, graphs, graphics, etc as needed to prioritize key information. Use sparingly.

## Themes

**Themes** are aliases and collections of specific colours for use in specific applications.

### Charts

Charts are themed collections of colours for use in, well, charting.

Currently, there is only one chart type - 12-tones - which were created for a specific, niche stacked-bar-chart idea.
